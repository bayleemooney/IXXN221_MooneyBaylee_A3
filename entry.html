                    The HTML Basics lectures were a great refresher on HTML coding. I learned details about code in a way which I had not considered important before, such as "head" and "body" parts. I have never truly coded but I have edited HTML before and found aspects coming back quickly. I was interested to learn about header tags and how you can set up to 6. I have never understood divs before, but the coding lectures and activities in class have helped with that. I think my main issue is that I had not understood the correlation between periods in css and classes in html, and hashtags for unique elements. Starting from scratch and working upwards as a class has made me more comfortable in approaching web design and I am excited to get into more complex coding.

                    I found creating customer personas and empathy maps easier with an end product in mind, rather than aspiring to fix large overlying problems. I really enjoyed working in a group for the empathy map, it offered a variety of perspectives and it was reassuring that we were all on the same page.

                    I chose Maddy from Euphoria (2019) as my user persona. While fictional and problematic, I feel that Maddy is a great representaion of Gen-Z. Considering elements of Maddy that could convert to a web product, I thought fashion or cosmetics would be good options.
