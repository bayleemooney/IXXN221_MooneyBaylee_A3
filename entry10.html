                    In developing this blog, I had a clear idea of how I wished it to look: simplistic with obvious navigation and high-contrast colours against an off-white background, which I have found to be more pleasant to read text against on a webpage. I created a rough sketch to begin, specifically for grids, but largely winged the coding of it.

                    After coding Assignment 2-1, approaching the blog was much more straight-forward, if not fun even. It was cool to simply try to enact a minimalist style in a way I like with code. In coding this blog, I learned much about manipulating divs and links, particularly setting them in HTML and linking them in CSS in an appropriate way for the output I was envisioning. Seeing that connection suddenly made navigating VSC much easier and optimised my workflow by making me think ahead more.

                    My biggest struggle in this course has undoubtedly been responsiveness in a webproduct and even with this blog I continue to struggle with it, as you may be able to tell. I can not seem to get media querys or grids to agree with me.
