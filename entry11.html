                    I have really enjoyed this course this trimester. The highlight has been a combination of the coding lectures and activites for me. They were super effective to go along with and have aided in my learning of HTML and CSS tremendously, as someone who has tried and given up on coding several times in the past.

                    If I could do anything differently, I would do more to not fall behind at such a critical point. I believe I definietly could have benefitted from using the in-class coding assistance more, but was hesitant to as I felt I should have been further along in the later weeks. Had this not happened, I think my final site for this course would have been more polished and I would have had time to do all of the pages I intented to.

                    That being said, I think the scope of my site was ambitious for my first time coding a whole website and I could have taken more considerations to scale back unneccessary elements early on. However, now knowing these unnceccessary elements and knowing HTML/CSS better as a whole, I feel I will have a better handle on the management of tasks in a webproduct project in the future. In addition, had I been a bit less stressed and had a bit more time to practice, I would have also participated in the presentations in-person to develop my public speaking ability and my ability to verbally communicate my design on the spot.

                    Ultimately, as far as first websites go, I am pretty happy with the one I produced for Assignment 2-2, in spite of issues with responsiveness and grids/layouts. After this course, I look forward to future coding projects and hopefully taking Web Design II next year.
