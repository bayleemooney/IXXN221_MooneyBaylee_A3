                    I learned about the types of user goals in web design, life goals, experience goals and end goals, which was helpful in designing goals for my user. Initially, I relied on my knowledge of Euphoria, before branching out into research of my user's wider market, Gen-Z. I tried to do as the lecturer, Shiv, said and keep asking "why?" until I can't and found this to be an effective method in developing a variety of goals, as well as deepening them. I have really enjoyed the group work so far and found it to be encouraging to create a diagram together before pursuing it on our own for our assignments.
