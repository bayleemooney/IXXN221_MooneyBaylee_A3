                    I found having my goals already outlined from last week to streamline my workflow while designing for my web product by saving time on unnecessary elements and creating a clear concept for my website. Creating a user flow and customer journey map was much less intimidating with clear goals, as well as the group activities in class. I considered other e-commerce cosmetics websites while developing my webproduct and found commanlities which I applied, due to Jakob's Law in the laws of UX. This helped in extending my considerations in my customer journey map and user flow.

                    The margin, border and padding coding activity in class was particularly helpful as I have struggled to visualise it.
