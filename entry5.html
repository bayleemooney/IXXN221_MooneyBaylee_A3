                    I have really enjoyed Assignmnet One. Going through the process of user to webproduct was very helpful in understanding how and why websites are designed for their ideal market the way they are. Using fictional characters as a basis also made the assignment feel more entertaining and applicable.

                    I believe this assignment alone has been beneficial to my development as a web and UX designer in learning the information and skills necessary in attempting to understand and design for a given user. I feel much more confident in my ability to carry out UX skills, such as developing user personas, empathy maps, customer journey maps and user flows - which makes me feel confident in approaching Assignment 2.
