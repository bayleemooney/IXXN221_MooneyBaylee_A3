                    The lecture on Colour Theory was very helpful in my development as a designer, especially as a total novice in Communication and UX design. I found the discussion around accessibility to be really interesting and have made the concious effort to utilise high contrast colours for readable content in all of my work. I have taken to using the suggested contrast checker site to check my colour pallettes regularly.

                    This is my first course in Interaction Design and I am still quite unfamiliar with designing for user experience, so I relied on UX Laws and research heavily in justifying my design decision for the first assignment. Having the lecturer go over the UX laws they felt were important was helpful in my learning and reassured me that I had been on the right track in talking about them previously. Though they often seem like common sense, I have begun to take notice and be critical of UX Laws I see in sites and the common themes among a certain type of webproduct.
