                    It was difficult picking an appropriate type which was both readable on my site but also fit the vibe. I knew I wanted a san-serif font to repesent the modern feel of my webproduct, as opposed to a serif font which I feel would have come across more traditional. However, I did not want an overly modern font to the point of futurism and explored display fonts which I feel were more suitable while also eye-catching. After a long search for a logo and headings font, I went with Lilita One, which was one of the available fonts on Figma. I also used DM Sans, the default Figma font, as my body text because I found it to match Lilita One, better than my first font choice of Helevetica.

                    The second part of the CSS Grids lectures was very helpful. The note about beginning with mobile and working your way up to desktop in developing a responsive grid/website, was a great tip and I wish I had done that from the start. I believe this tripped me up the most in coding, as I was consistently going between grids and using grids within grids, to the point of confusing myself. In the future, I will be more diligent in considering responsiveness and plan to design in the mobile-to-desktop flow next time from the beginning.

                    I also struggled and continue to struggle with responsiveness, and often found myself frustrated with the lack of smoothness in the transitions, hence perhaps spending too much energy and time attempting to make my site smooth at every interval and wasting efforts I could have put towards other elements.
