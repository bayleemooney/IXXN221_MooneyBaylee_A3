                    This assignment was definitely more challenging for me than the previous assignment. After falling behind due to personal situations, I struggled to keep up with every iteration week-by-week. Nonetheless, this was the first time I have been offered such a clear process of development and really enjoyed being able to see the changes and progress of my webproduct across my iterations.

                    I tested a few different layouts between my iterations, particularly as I learned more about coding and believed some of my initial ideas may go beyond the scope of my HTML and CSS capacities. Upon seeing the exemplar for this assignment, I wish I had followed suit and created individual paper versions of my layout elements to easily switch them and get a clearer vision of the layout I may end up using.

                    While this project was difficult, I learned more than I ever have about HTML and CSS. I also feel infinitely more capable in my web design capabilities after the challenge of coding my first website.
